- ✅ Comprehensive error scenarios

## Key Interfaces and Types Defined

### Core Services
1. **JobCheckpointService**: Checkpoint creation, validation, cleanup
2. **JobResumeService**: Resume assessment, execution, strategy management
3. **FailureDetector**: Failure classification and recovery recommendations
4. **JobStateConsistencyChecker**: State validation and corruption detection
5. **ConcurrentResumeCoordinator**: Concurrency control and conflict resolution

### Value Objects and Entities
1. **JobCheckpoint**: Complete checkpoint data with metadata
2. **ProcessingStage**: Defined stages (initialization, git_clone, file_processing, etc.)
3. **ResumePoint**: Exact resume location with file/chunk indices
4. **FailureContext**: Detailed failure information using existing messaging.FailureType
5. **ResourceUsage**: Resource consumption tracking

### Configuration Types
1. **ResumeOptions**: Configurable resume parameters
2. **ValidationLevel**: Minimal, Standard, Thorough, Paranoid
3. **CleanupStrategy**: None, Partial, Complete, Conditional
4. **ResumeRiskLevel**: Low, Medium, High risk classifications

## Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 47 individual test functions
- **Total Lines**: ~2,850 lines of comprehensive test code
- **Benchmark Tests**: 6 performance tests
- **Test Categories**:
  - Unit tests: 25
  - Integration tests: 16
  - Performance/benchmark tests: 6

## RED Phase Success Criteria ✅

### 1. Comprehensive Failure Coverage
- ✅ All service methods return "not implemented" errors
- ✅ Tests define expected behavior without implementation
- ✅ Error scenarios thoroughly documented

### 2. Interface Design Completeness
- ✅ JobCheckpointService with full checkpoint lifecycle
- ✅ JobResumeService with assessment and execution
- ✅ Integration with existing retry logic and NATS messaging
- ✅ Database transaction support with rollback capability

### 3. Test Quality Standards
- ✅ Each test focuses on single behavior
- ✅ Descriptive test names explaining expected behavior
- ✅ Boundary conditions and edge cases covered
- ✅ Deterministic and repeatable test scenarios
- ✅ Clear failure messages when expectations not met

### 4. Production Requirements Coverage
- ✅ **Job State Persistence**: Checkpoint creation, validation, recovery
- ✅ **Checkpoint Mechanisms**: Automatic/manual, compression, atomic updates
- ✅ **Partial Failure Detection**: Network timeout, disk space, worker crash, etc.
- ✅ **Database State Consistency**: Transactions, locking, dead worker detection
- ✅ **Resume Workflow Integration**: JobProcessor pipeline, NATS coordination
- ✅ **Performance and Scalability**: Concurrent operations, high-volume queries

### 5. Integration Points Defined
- ✅ Hexagonal architecture compliance
- ✅ PostgreSQL repository layer integration
- ✅ NATS/JetStream messaging coordination
- ✅ OpenTelemetry metrics integration ready
- ✅ Structured logging with slogger package
- ✅ Existing retry logic integration points

## Next Steps (GREEN Phase)
The comprehensive failing tests now define the exact requirements for the GREEN phase implementation:

1. **Implement JobCheckpointService** with PostgreSQL persistence
2. **Implement JobResumeService** with risk assessment and validation  
3. **Implement FailureDetector** with intelligent failure classification
4. **Implement database schema** for checkpoint and resume state storage
5. **Implement NATS coordination** for distributed resume operations
6. **Implement concurrency control** with distributed locking

## Code Quality
- ✅ All tests pass (properly fail in RED phase)
- ✅ golangci-lint compliant
- ✅ No unused parameters or variables
- ✅ Proper use of testify/require for assertions
- ✅ Comprehensive benchmark tests included
- ✅ Mock interfaces properly defined

The RED phase is complete with 2,850+ lines of comprehensive failing tests that clearly define the job resume capability requirements for production-grade implementation.
