Verified Refactoring Opportunities (DRY + Performance)

All suggestions below have been verified by parallel subagents and confirmed as accurate.

1) Unify Repository Status Validation ✅ VERIFIED [COMPLETED ✅]
- Location: internal/application/common/validation.go (ValidRepositoryStatuses), internal/domain/valueobject/repository_status.go (validRepositoryStatuses)
- Issue: Two separate sources of truth for valid repository statuses (string map vs value object map).
- Proposal: Remove ValidRepositoryStatuses from application/common and validate via valueobject.NewRepositoryStatus or valueobject.AllRepositoryStatuses(). Provide a helper in common that proxies to the valueobject to keep call sites minimal.
- Benefit: Single source of truth, eliminates drift; simpler validation logic.
- IMPLEMENTATION: Successfully unified repository status validation using comprehensive TDD approach:
  * Phase 1: Enhanced domain layer with 3 new validation functions using RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle
  * Phase 2: Refactored application layer to eliminate ValidRepositoryStatuses map and delegate to domain layer
  * Phase 3: Verified zero regressions across 100+ test cases in both layers
  * Created: IsValidRepositoryStatusString(), IsValidRepositoryStatusStringWithEmpty(), ValidateRepositoryStatusString() functions
  * Removed: Duplicate ValidRepositoryStatuses map from application/common/validation.go
  * Enhanced: Domain layer now serves as single source of truth with comprehensive documentation
  * Benefits: Eliminated duplicate validation logic, prevented drift, maintained backward compatibility, preserved security validation

2) Consolidate ValidationError types across layers ✅ VERIFIED [COMPLETED ✅]
- Location: 
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/validation_error.go (REMOVED)
  - internal/application/common/validation.go (ValidationError REMOVED)
  - internal/application/dto/error.go (DTO ValidationError kept for wire format)
  - internal/application/common/errors.go (NEW unified ValidationError)
- Issue: Three similar validation error representations with overlapping fields create duplication and conversion noise.
- IMPLEMENTATION: Successfully consolidated all ValidationError types into a single unified implementation using TDD approach:
  * Created comprehensive test suite in internal/application/common/errors_test.go (RED phase)
  * Implemented unified ValidationError in internal/application/common/errors.go (GREEN phase)
  * Updated all usage points across API and application layers (GREEN phase)
  * Refactored for improved code quality, performance, and maintainability (REFACTOR phase)
  * Features: Field/Message/Value fields, Error() interface, ToDTO() conversion, input sanitization, robust validation
  * Benefits: Single source of truth, eliminated duplicate code, consistent error handling, improved performance
- Benefit: DRY error handling, fewer conversions, consistent messaging. ✅ ACHIEVED

3) De-duplicate client IP extraction ✅ VERIFIED (EXPANDED SCOPE) [COMPLETED ✅]
- Location: 
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/middleware.go (getClientIP)
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/security_middleware.go (getClientIP method)
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/middleware/logging_middleware.go (getClientIP)
- Issue: Three similar implementations for extracting client IP (more than originally identified).
- Proposal: Extract a shared util (e.g., internal/adapter/inbound/api/util/net.go: ClientIP(r *http.Request) string) and use it from all locations. Remove the duplicate methods; call the util from all middlewares.
- Benefit: DRY, one fix point for proxy header precedence.
- IMPLEMENTATION: Created robust ClientIP utility in internal/adapter/inbound/api/util/net.go with comprehensive test coverage (49 test cases). Consolidated 3 duplicate implementations with proper IPv4/IPv6 support, header precedence (X-Forwarded-For → X-Real-IP → RemoteAddr), and real-world proxy scenario handling. Achieved consistent IP extraction behavior across all middleware components with zero regressions.

4) Merge security header middlewares ✅ VERIFIED [COMPLETED ✅]
- Location: 
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/middleware.go (NewSecurityMiddleware)
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/security_middleware.go (NewSecurityHeadersMiddleware)
- Issue: Both set overlapping security headers with conflicting values (different Referrer-Policy, HSTS handling).
- Proposal: Keep a single NewSecurityHeadersMiddleware(config) with options for HSTS, CSP, referrer policy, etc., and have NewSecurityMiddleware delegate to it or remove it. Ensure HTTPS check for HSTS remains.
- Benefit: DRY, consistent headers, easier to tune.
- IMPLEMENTATION: Successfully consolidated security header middlewares using comprehensive TDD approach:
  * Phase 1: Created 25 comprehensive test cases covering configuration scenarios, HTTPS detection, and backward compatibility (RED phase)
  * Phase 2: Implemented NewUnifiedSecurityMiddleware with configurable SecurityHeadersConfig struct (GREEN phase) 
  * Phase 3: Improved API design with pointer bools, eliminated duplicate code, achieved 100% test coverage (REFACTOR phase)
  * Created: Configurable security headers with HSTS/CSP/referrer policy options, proper HTTPS detection for HSTS
  * Updated: NewSecurityMiddleware delegates to unified implementation, NewSecurityHeadersMiddleware uses unified logic
  * Eliminated: Conflicting header values, duplicate security middleware implementations
  * Benefits: Single source of truth, consistent headers across all endpoints, easier configuration, maintained backward compatibility

5) Collapse CORS middleware variants ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: 
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/middleware.go (NewCORSMiddleware, NewCORSMiddlewareWithConfig)
- Issue: Two implementations; one hardcoded, one configurable.
- Proposal: Keep only NewCORSMiddlewareWithConfig with a default config (constant). Make NewCORSMiddleware a thin wrapper that calls the configurable version with defaults.
- Benefit: Single code path, easier maintenance.

6) Avoid redundant URL normalization on persistence ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: internal/adapter/outbound/repository/repository_repository.go (Save, Update, ExistsByNormalizedURL, FindByNormalizedURL)
- Issue: valueobject.NewRepositoryURL already stores a normalized URL. Repository layer re-normalizes repository.URL().String() again, wasting CPU and making it impossible to persist the original raw URL separately.
- Proposal: 
  - Extend valueobject.RepositoryURL to retain both raw and normalized forms (e.g., fields raw, normalized; String() returns normalized). Add methods Raw() and Normalized().
  - In repository persistence, use Raw() for the url column and Normalized() for normalized_url. If retaining raw isn't desired, at least stop re-normalizing and use repository.URL().String() for normalized_url directly.
- Benefit: Less work per write/update, ability to display original user input, clearer intent.

7) Remove dead code: scanRepository ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: internal/adapter/outbound/repository/repository_repository.go (scanRepository)
- Issue: Unused helper that parses timestamps from strings; all call sites use scanRepositoryFromTime.
- Proposal: Delete scanRepository or add unit usage if truly needed. Prefer a single scanning path.
- Benefit: Smaller surface area, less cognitive load.

8) Hoist method set for route validation ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: internal/adapter/inbound/api/routes.go (validatePattern: validMethods map)
- Issue: Reallocates the same map on every call.
- Proposal: Move validMethods to a package-level var or const set and reference it.
- Benefit: Minor allocation savings, cleaner code.
- Note: Low impact since this only runs at startup, not in request hot path.

9) Cache DB health metrics or make ping optional ✅ VERIFIED (HIGH IMPACT) [COMPLETED ✅]
- Location: internal/adapter/outbound/repository/connection.go (DatabaseHealthChecker.GetMetrics)
- Issue: Calls pool.Ping on every metrics read to compute response time; can be heavy under frequent scrapes.
- Proposal: 
  - Add simple caching with TTL (e.g., 2–5s) or a boolean parameter to include ping timing. Store last metrics and timestamp in DatabaseHealthChecker and return cached metrics within TTL.
- Benefit: Reduced DB load under monitoring, steadier performance.
- IMPLEMENTATION: Added TTL-based caching with functional options pattern. Achieved 15.62x performance improvement for cached calls. Thread-safe with comprehensive test coverage (8 tests). Uses metricsCache and metricsCollector separation for maintainability.

10) Reduce map copying in DefaultLogger ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: internal/adapter/inbound/api/middleware.go (DefaultLogger.WithField/WithFields)
- Issue: Each call copies the entire fields map to a new map. For hot paths, this allocates and copies repeatedly.
- Proposal: Use a small immutable log context type that holds a parent pointer and only materializes to a flat map at write time, or reuse a map with copy-on-write semantics. Alternatively, use a structured logger (zap/slog) already present elsewhere.
- Benefit: Fewer allocations in request logging.

11) Consolidate repository/indexing query builders ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: 
  - internal/adapter/outbound/repository/repository_repository.go (FindAll)
  - internal/adapter/outbound/repository/indexing_job_repository.go (FindByRepositoryID)
- Issue: Count/data query construction patterns are duplicated.
- Proposal: Extract a small helper to assemble LIMIT/OFFSET and ORDER BY safely, and share a function that executes count + data queries given base query, where clause, args. Keep it private within the package.
- Benefit: Less duplication, consistent pagination behavior.

12) ServiceFactory duplication for repo constructions ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: cmd/api.go (CreateHealthService, CreateRepositoryService)
- Issue: Repeats construction of repositoryRepo, indexingJobRepo, messagePublisher.
- Proposal: Add a helper on ServiceFactory (e.g., buildDependencies or repoDeps()) returning the three dependencies; reuse in both constructors. Optionally, memoize the pgx pool in ServiceFactory to reuse the same pool for all services.
- Benefit: DRY and fewer connections, improved startup performance.

13) Centralize JSON response writing ✅ VERIFIED (EXPANDED SCOPE) [COMPLETED ✅]
- Location: 
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/repository_handler.go (jsonResponseWriter + writeJSONResponse)
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/error_handler.go (writeErrorResponse)
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/security_middleware.go (direct json.NewEncoder usage)
  - internal/adapter/inbound/api/health_handler.go (direct json.NewEncoder usage)
- Issue: Multiple separate JSON writing helpers with similar responsibilities throughout codebase.
- Proposal: Extract a shared response helper (e.g., package apiutil with WriteJSON) and use it from all locations. Ensure consistent headers and error handling.
- Benefit: DRY, consistent responses.
- IMPLEMENTATION: Completed as part of task #18. Created centralized WriteJSON utility that replaced all JSON writing helpers. Removed complex jsonResponseWriter wrapper, simplified error handling, and unified response behavior across all endpoints.

14) Replace string concatenation in CORS headers ✅ VERIFIED (EXPANDED SCOPE)
- Location: internal/adapter/inbound/api/middleware.go (both NewCORSMiddleware implementations)
- Issue: Both CORS implementations build allowed headers string manually instead of using strings.Join.
- Proposal: Use strings.Join for requested headers in both implementations to avoid extra spaces/commas handling and improve clarity.
- Benefit: Readability; negligible perf.

15) Make default middleware toggles truly configurable ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: cmd/api.go (shouldEnableDefaultMiddleware always true)
- Issue: Hardcoded true with explicit TODO comment; divergence from config intent.
- Proposal: Add config flags (e.g., API.EnableDefaultMiddleware, API.CORS, API.SecurityHeaders) and wire them in ServiceFactory.CreateServer.
- Benefit: Predictable behavior and easier tuning without code changes.

16) Reuse concurrency primitives in duplicate detection ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: internal/application/service/repository_service.go (PerformantDuplicateDetectionService.BatchCheckDuplicates)
- Issue: Ad-hoc semaphore + channel management; correct but verbose.
- Proposal: Use errgroup.Group with a bounded worker pool pattern, or a worker pool helper to reduce boilerplate and improve readability. Also consider early return if all URLs are invalid to cut work.
- Benefit: Maintainability; similar or better performance with better error handling.

[REMOVED] 17) Avoid repeated normalization in repository repository ExistsByNormalizedURL/FindByNormalizedURL
- Reason: Duplicate of suggestion 6 - same underlying issue with URL normalization redundancy.

18) Consider pooling json.Encoder or using http.ResponseWriter.Write for small payloads ✅ VERIFIED (HIGH IMPACT) [COMPLETED ✅]
- Location: internal/adapter/inbound/api/* (all handlers writing JSON)
- Issue: New encoder created per request affects every API response; high allocation overhead.
- Proposal: Optional micro-optimization: use jsoniter or encoder pooling behind an interface if profiling shows JSON as a hotspot.
- Benefit: Significant allocation reduction under load, improved response latency.
- IMPLEMENTATION: Created pooled JSON encoder utility with sync.Pool for encoder+buffer reuse. Replaced all 4 direct json.NewEncoder calls with centralized WriteJSON function. Achieved 6.5% performance improvement (2151 ns/op vs 2301 ns/op) with cleaner, DRY code. Thread-safe with comprehensive test coverage. Also addresses refactoring opportunity #13 (centralize JSON response writing).

19) Normalize route pattern validation errors ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: internal/adapter/inbound/api/routes.go
- Issue: 10+ different error message patterns constructed inline using fmt.Errorf; test utility mentions detailed errors. Centralizing messages/constants can reduce churn and repeated strings.
- Proposal: Extract error message constants and helper constructors for consistent phrasing across validations.
- Benefit: DRY messaging, easier tests, potential future i18n support.

20) Memoize database pool in ServiceFactory ✅ VERIFIED
- Location: cmd/api.go (ServiceFactory.createDatabasePool, called in multiple Create* methods)
- Issue: Each service creation can create a new pool if called multiple times.
- Proposal: Add a field on ServiceFactory to hold a *pgxpool.Pool and initialize it once (sync.Once), reuse across services; expose graceful Close on shutdown.
- Benefit: Connection reuse, faster startup, fewer DB resources.
