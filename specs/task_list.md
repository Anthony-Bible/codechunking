   - Establishes clear specifications before any implementation

2. **GREEN PHASE**: Use `@agent-green-phase-implementer` to make tests pass
   - Implements minimal code needed to satisfy failing tests
   - Focuses on functionality over optimization
   - Ensures all tests pass with clean, working code

3. **REFACTOR PHASE**: Use `@agent-tdd-refactor-specialist` to optimize
   - Improves code quality while keeping all tests green
   - Eliminates duplication, enhances performance, adds enterprise features
   - Results in production-ready code with maintained test coverage

**Example Usage**: "I need to implement Phase 2.3 security validation. Use @agent-red-phase-tester to create failing tests for input sanitization first."
