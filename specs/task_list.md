# Code Chunking Project: Comprehensive Task List

## Project Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive task list for implementing a code chunking and retrieval system as described in the PRD. The system will index code repositories, chunk code into semantic units, generate embeddings, and provide a query API for retrieving relevant code snippets based on natural language queries.

## Project Phases and Timeline

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - 16 weeks
The MVP will focus on implementing the core functionality required for a working system:
- Repository indexing API
- Asynchronous processing
- Basic code chunking for Go language
- Embedding generation
- Vector storage and retrieval
- Simple query API

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features - 8 weeks
After the MVP, we'll focus on enhancing the system with additional features:
- Support for more programming languages
- Improved chunking strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced query capabilities

### Phase 3: Production Readiness - 6 weeks
The final phase will focus on making the system production-ready:
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation
- Monitoring and observability
- Security enhancements
